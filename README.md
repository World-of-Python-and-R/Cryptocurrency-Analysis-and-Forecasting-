# Cryptocurrecy-Forecasting-and-Analysis-
This Projects deals with the analysis of various cryptocurrencies and their deep analysis in terms of trends and forecasting. 

The success of bitcoin, measured by its rapid market capitalization growth and price appreciation, led to the emergence of a large number of other cryptocurrencies (e.g. Dogecoin, USD coin, Tether coin, Etherium coin etc.). By now, the market of cryptocurrencies has become one of the largest unregulated markets in the world. This Projects deals with the analysis of various cryptocurrencies and their deep analysis in terms of trends and forecasting. In this project we use ARIMA time series forecasting and various plotting libraraies in terms plotting the trends and also plotting the forecasting.

In this project we worked upon the analysis of following 10 categories of cryptocurrencies:

# defining categories 

category1 = 'BTC-USD' # bitcoin
category2 = 'ETH-USD' # etherium coin
category3 = 'USDT-USD' # tether coin
category4 = 'BNB-USD' # Binance coin 
category5 = 'ADA-USD' # cardano coin 
category6 = 'HEX-USD' # hex coin  
category7 = 'XRP-USD' # XRP Coin 
category8 = 'USDC-USD' #  USD coin 
category9 = 'DOGE-USD' # Doge coin 
category10 = 'DOT1-USD' # Polka Dot coin 

Every time when the user will access the below mentioned link, the updated recent real time data will be downloaded via API of Yahoo finance. DataSet contains five features which are as follows:

# open = starting price on the openeing day 
# high  = highest price attained on the same day 
# Low = lowest price attained on the same day 
# Close = closing price on the same day 
# Adj close  = splitting phenomenon # adjusted close 
# volume  = total number coins available in the market on the same day
