The success of bitcoin, measured by its rapid market capitalization growth and price appreciation, led to the emergence of a large number of other cryptocurrencies (e.g. Dogecoin, USD coin, Tether coin, Etherium coin etc.). By now, the market of cryptocurrencies has become one of the largest unregulated markets in the world. This Projects deals with the analysis of various cryptocurrencies and their deep analysis in terms of trends and forecasting. In this project we use ARIMA time series forecasting and various plotting libraraies in terms plotting the trends and also plotting the forecasting.

category1 = 'BTC-USD' # bitcoin <br/>
category2 = 'ETH-USD' # etherium coin <br/>
category3 = 'USDT-USD' # tether coin <br/>
